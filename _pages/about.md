I am a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science department at Purdue University, working under the guidance of Prof. Antonio Bianchi. My research interests encompass a wide range of mobile security topics, with a current focus on SMS OTP authentication, Android scoped storage vulnerability analysis, and mobile driving license standard ISO 18013-5. I primarily concentrate on developing novel security frameworks by leveraging differential analysis for vulnerability detection and formal verification techniques to ensure the robustness of mobile systems.
